## Child care
If you forsee needing child care support, please [contact us asap](/contact/). We plan to reserve child care through [WeVillage](https://www.wevillage.com/centers/the-pearl), but also have flexibility to tailor financial support to your specific needs.

In either case, **please contact us as soon as possible**. We would like to make a group-reservation with the facility by **July 17th**, 2019. This will help us to pay for your reservation up-front and avoid the hardship of waiting on reimbursements.

Children 3-4 years old may participate in this camp for the first portion of the day (9am-1pm).  Children will transition to regular center activities after these hours.

We hope to be able to cover everyone’s childcare needs, but space and funding is limited, so **please contact us as soon as possible** if you anticipate needing childcare services.

## Workshop location resources
There are baby changing tables in every bathroom on all five floors of the White Stag Block and a lactation room on second floor. Participants can acquire a key to this room from the front desk, and we will work out a schedule as needed if multiple people would like access and privacy.

A library on the ground floor is available as a quiet space and can be accessed during the workshop. It also has a “talk box” for telephone calls.
