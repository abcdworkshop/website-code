<h2><span style="background-color: #38a7bb">Accessing ABCD data</span></h2>
Prior to the workshop, you will need to apply to access the ABCD data. This process requires insitutional approval and can take weeks to months depending in your university. Please see the [How To Access ABCD Data](/access-abcd/) page for instructions.

## Communication
Slack will be the main communication platform during the workshop. If you have not joined the Slack workshop, please do so asap! If you need another email invitation, please [contact us](/contact/).

## Location
### Address
White Stag Block  
70 NW Couch St  
Portland, OR 97209

### Transportation
Portland public transportation is relatively good, but road traffic can be pretty bad, so if you find an airbnb that seems a bit further out (e.g. in another quadrant of the city), check out how quick the bus/streetcar/MAX could take you to our venue (The White Stag Block). It is a very cycle-friendly city, so renting a bike is also a great option if you plan to stay further out. 

Information about Portland public transportation can be found on the [TriMet website](https://trimet.org/).

For those driving, please [see this flyer](https://multco.us/file/73135/download) for more information on parking near the White Stag Block.

## Accommodation
On the Slack workspace you will find the channel called #accommodation, where you can coordinate with other attendees to share housing/rooms. We are also recommending the nearby [Society Hotel](https://thesocietyhotel.com/) for attendees, as it has a range of accommodation options (from hostel-style bunks to king suites). 

Parking info from the [Society Hotel website](https://thesocietyhotel.com/):

>There is a Smart Park garage three blocks away from our hotel at 33 NW Davis Street. The rates there are $15-$25 for 24 hours. Street parking is also free from 7pm until 8am and is pay to park hourly during the day. We are in the entertainment district downtown, so on Friday And Saturday nights some of the streets around the hotel are closed to car traffic to make it more safe and fun for pedestrians. When you arrive you are welcome to park in front of the hotel in our loading zone and we can help you decide then as well!
