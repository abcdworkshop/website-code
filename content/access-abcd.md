  + First, click the “Data Permissions” tab in the top left corner of your NDA dashboard.

3.	Read the instructions for the NDA Data Use Certificate (DUC). 
4.	Provide a description of your research project/research-related need.  In your case, this can just be a description of the ABCD workshop and what you hope to learn, but it may be worth writing something that more broadly captures your research interests and goals, so that this DUC is useful to you going forward.
5.	The website will provide you with a list of appropriate signing officials (SO) based on your current institutional affiliation.  It is a good idea to reach out to your SO as soon as possible, because getting their signature can take up to a couple of months.  
6.	Note: If more than one person from your institution is attending the workshop, you should be able to complete one request for shared data access and simply add each workshop attendee to the additional personnel list by selecting and linking each attendee’s NDA account username.  
7.	Once all of these steps have been completed, you should be able to download a pdf copy of your DUC by clicking on the “Permissions” tab of your NDA dashboard.  Please email us a copy of this DUC.
