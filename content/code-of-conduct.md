The ABCD Workshop is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organizers.

## Expectations
It is our expectation that event participants will not engage in harassment of any kind, including:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.  
* Sexual images in public spaces  
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following  
* Harassing photography or recording  
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events  
* Unwelcome or inappropriate physical contact   
* Unwelcome sexual attention  
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. All organizers and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, they should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. 

## Consequences
If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the event with no refund and/or not being allowed to participate in future events. Event organizers may take action to redress anything that disrupts the event or makes the environment hostile for any participants.

## If you experience or witness any violations...
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People who speak up make our event a better place. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. You can make a report through the [contact form](/contact/) either using your personal email or anonomously by using abcdworkshop@gmail.com as the sender email.
